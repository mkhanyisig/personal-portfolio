          I've gained experience and exposure across diverse technology stacks
          and problem domains, primarily focusing on Web Applications, Data
          Processing, and Task Automation. My journey has involved mastering
          various frameworks, tools, and libraries. The primary programming

          My young career journey thus far has predominantly unfolded within
          research/class projects, small autonomous teams, and startup
          environments. I've owned end-to-end feature implementations and
          deployment, including ensuring Figma designs that match the final User
          Interface and are performant, reusable, and scalable solutions. Adept
          at automating tasks and orchestrating functions that utilize
          third-party APIâ€™s or cloud services, I've consistently delivered
          impactful solutions. I remain dedicated to continuous growth and
          innovation in software development.

          My educational journey, which includes both an MS and a BS in Computer
          Science, has equipped me with robust problem-solving skills and a
          solid foundation in computational thinking. Recognizing the dynamic
          nature of the tech industry, I am deeply committed to continual
          self-improvement. I actively engage in self-study and seek out
          opportunities to learn new technologies, ensuring that my skills
          remain current and adaptable to industry demands.
